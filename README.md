# DreamBerd
DreamBerd is a perfect programming language.

## Exclamation Marks!
Be bold! End every statement with an exclamation mark!
```c
print("Hello world")!
```

If you're feeling extra-bold, you can use even more!!!
```c
print("Hello world")!!!
```

If you're unsure, that's ok. You can put a question mark at the end of a line instead. It prints debug information about that line to the console for you.
```c
print("Hello world")?
```

You might be wondering what DreamBerd uses for the 'not' operator, which is an exclamation mark in most other languages. That's simple - the 'not' operator is a semi-colon instead.
```c
if (;false) {
  print("Hello world")!
}
```

## Declarations
There are four types of declaration. Constant constants can't be changed in any way.
```java
const const name = "Luke"!
```

Constant variables can be edited, but not re-assigned.
```java
const var name = "Luke"!
name.remove(2, 3)!
```

Variable constants can be re-assigned, but not edited.
```java
var const name = "Luke"!
name = "Lu"!
```

Variable variables can be re-assigned and edited.
```java
var var name = "Luke"!
name = "Lu"!
name.push("ke")!
```

## Booleans
Booleans can be `true`, `false` or `maybe`.
