# DreamBerd
DreamBerd is a perfect programming language.

# Exclamation Marks
Be bold! End every statement with an exclamation mark!
```js
print("Hello world")!
```

If you're feeling extra-bold, you can use even more!!!
```js
print("Hello world")!!!
```

If you're unsure, that's ok. You can put a question mark at the end of a line instead. It prints debug information about that line to the console for you.
```js
print("Hello world")?
```

You might be wondering what DreamBerd uses for the 'not' operator, which is an exclamation mark in most other languages. That's simple - the 'not' operator is a semi-colon instead.
```js
if (;false) {
  print("Hello world")!
}
```
